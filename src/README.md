#Cookie: The circus trick!

We have a couple of Animals(Robotic ones)  in our Circus, 
and we used to blow a whistle to make'em do some tricks.

- Lion roars
- Cow moos
- Dog dances Diomedez DÃ­az's songs
- Turtle sleeps(All the day)
- Cat sometimes meows, sometimes jumps.. sometimes goes crazy IoI
